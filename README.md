# EchoPrint
Echo Print is a .NET MAUI voice memo app to record, save, and organise audio locally. Each note stores title, timestamp, optional photo, and can be marked favourite. Uses SQLite for offline storage and a simple dark UI, making it easy to extend with features like location or cloud sync.
